## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages:
    - `dateutil`
    - `coinbase`
    - `robin_stocks`
    - `selenium`
    - `xlwings`
    - `pandas`
    - `PyPDF2`

## Usage

To use the script, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that all required Python packages are installed.
2. Set up the necessary configurations in the Excel workbook referenced by the script.
3. Run the script using Python.
   - If ran from the terminal (rather than from Excel VBA), run with the current directory being a subfolder of the folder holding the .xlsm workbook. And be sure to manually pass along the creds while instantiating the object. 
     - `from retrieve_creds import retrieve_creds_for_money_manager`
     - `from Money_Manager import Money_Manager`
     - `creds = retrieve_creds_for_money_manager()`
     - `money_manager = Money_Manager(creds)`
   - The creds are actually optional and not needed for calling methods that don't require API access

The script performs various tasks such as:

- Retrieving transaction data from online banking portals.
- Categorizing transactions and updating Excel spreadsheets accordingly.
- Fetching investment information from Robinhood and Coinbase.
- Downloading eStatements from online banking portals.

### The investment portfolio part:

| Symbol | Name | Investment Type | Sector | Industry | Current Quantity | Current Equity | All Time Net Loss or Gain |
|--------|------|-----------------|--------|----------|------------------|----------------|--------------------------|

## Configuration

Before running the script, make sure to set up the following configurations:

- Excel Workbook: The script requires access to an Excel workbook containing necessary reference data and configurations. Update the file path in the script to point to the correct workbook.
- Account Credentials: Provide credentials for accessing online banking platforms, Robinhood, and Coinbase if required.
- Browser Driver: Ensure that the appropriate browser driver (e.g., ChromeDriver) is installed and its path is specified correctly in the script.
